 ZONEBUDGET version 3.2                  

 Program to compute a flow budget for subregions of a model using
 budget data from MODFLOW-2005 flavored models.

 With enhancements for:
                       MODFLOW
           ONE-WATER HYDROLOGIC-FLOW MODEL

   The U.S. Geological Survey Modular Finite-Difference
          Conjunctive Use Simulation Program

 Zone Array for layer   1 will be read from file: izone_lay1.txt                        From "OPEN/CLOSE"
 Zone Array for layer   1 will be read using free format.
 Zone Array for layer   2 will be read from file: izone_lay2.txt                        From "OPEN/CLOSE"
 Zone Array for layer   2 will be read using free format.

 Zone Array for layer   3 is set equal to: 3                        From "CONSTANT"
