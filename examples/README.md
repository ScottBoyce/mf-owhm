# MODFLOW-OWHM Example Problems

This directory contains the example problems used to validate MF-OWHM. 

These examples have been compiled from all the releases of MODFLOW that MF-OWHM supports and includes additional developed examples.

In each example directory contains two sub-directories: `output-true` and `output`. 

- The directory `output` is the location that example problem simulated results are written to. 
- The directory `output-true` contains select output files that are considered the correct solution that are used for comparison purposes.

Special thanks to Jon Traum for developing the MF-OWHM

## Bash Driver File

A series of bash files are written that when executed run the example problems.
