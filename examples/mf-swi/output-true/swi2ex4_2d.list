 Final Remark:

   The solver successfully met the user supplied convergence criteria, HCLOSE and RCLOSE, for all 1300 time steps.

   Please check the "VOLUMETRIC BUDGET FOR ENTIRE MODEL" to ensure that mass rate balance errors are acceptable for all time steps.

   The cumulative mass error for the entire simulation is 0.00 %
