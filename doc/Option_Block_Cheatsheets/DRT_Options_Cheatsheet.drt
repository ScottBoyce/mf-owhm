# Listing of all available Options for the DRT package
# 
# The Option block is placed at the start of the DRT package input.
# If there are additional input blocks, then the order the blocks does not matter
#
BEGIN OPTIONS
    #
    # RETURNFLOW keyword activates the return-flow option of the DRT Package. 
    # This results in 
    #
    # If option is present, then the input expects LayR, RowR, ColR, and Rfprop to be read.
    #
    # --NOTE THAT IF THIS KEYWORD IS NOT PRESENT, THEN DRT IS EQUIVALENT TO DRN--
    # ----and does not route drain flow to another cell or to another package----
    RETURNFLOW

    # General Options --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    #
    # Suppress writing to LIST file the DRT input information after it is read in.
    NO_PRINT
    #
    # Read network for first stress period, then reuse for rest of simulation.
    #   Use Time Series Input, TABFILEs, or LineFeed to specify segment FLOW
    #
    AUTOMATIC_NEGATIVE_ITMP
    #
    # Defines auxiliary values that are read with input.
    #   AuxName is the specific auxiliary value that is read.
    AUXILIARY  AuxName
    AUX        AuxName

    # Output Files ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    #   Generic_Output is a place holder for the output file location.
    #   The file name that is commented to the right is the recommended name.
    #   Example use:
    #               DBFILE   ./output/DRT_output.txt
    #
    # Print for each DRT cell, for all time steps, in a column based format, 
    #   the drt cell properties (elevation, conductance), the cell's head, and
    #   drt flow out of the cell, and its return location.
    #
    DBFILE                  Generic_Output                  # DRT_output.txt
    #
    # The following keyword provides summary information about each DRT file.
    # This output file prints to either a binary file or text (ASCII) file, 
    # 
    # Each time step writes out a header with information about the time step
    #   and the subsequent lines contain the drain information for that time step.
    #
    PRINTFILE               Generic_Output                  # DRT_drain_flows.txt
