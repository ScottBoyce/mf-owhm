# Listing of all available Options for the MNW2 package
#
# Options are grouped based on common usage or when only one should be selected
#
# The Option block is placed at the start of the MNW2 package input.
#    If there are multiple block style inputs (BEGIN/END), the order of the blocks does not matter.

    # Output Files ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    #   Generic_Output is a place holder for the output file location.
    #   The file name that is commented to the right is the recommended name.
    #   Example use:
    #               PRINT_WELL_PUMPING   ./output/MNW2_Pumping.txt
    #
    # Simple output that prints for all active wells Desired and Actual pumping and the Well Head
    PRINT_WELL_PUMPING    GENERIC_OUTPUT                      # MNW2_Pumping.txt
    #
    #Similar to previous output, but includes total groundwater flow into the well and out of the well
    PRINT_WELL_INOUT      GENERIC_OUTPUT                      # MNW2_INOUT.txt
    #
    # Prints each well's desired pumping rate and each of its nodes flow rates
    PRINT_WELL_NODE_FLOW  GENERIC_OUTPUT                      # MNW2_Node_Flow.txt
    #
    # Prints each well's node flow rate between the node and model cell, the node's well head, cell's head, and conductance.
    #    The well head is either the entire well's head value or the cell's bottom elevation.
    PRINT_NODE_INFO       GENERIC_OUTPUT                      # MNW2_Node_Info.txt   #Head and Cond by Node

    # If screen interval is less than FracScrn fraction of layer then ignore that section of the screen
    #     --If screen includes multiple layers and is >FracScrn, then those are simulated.
    #   If not specified then FracScrn = 0.01, which indicates well screens are ignored if they are less than 1% of a layer.

    # Iteration limit before holding partial penetration correction factor constant.
    # The correction factor is applied to the estimated well node's pumping rate, which changes every solver iteration.
    #  If not specified, then MxIter = 15
    #     That is, the PP correction factor is calculated for the first 15 solver iterations, then held constant.
    #     Typically after 15 iterations the correction factor no longer changes.
    PP_CON_ITER_LIM        MxIter

    # Defines auxiliary values that are read with input.
    #   AuxName is the specific auxiliary value that is read.

    # Special Options - NOT RECOMMENDED - USE WITH CAUTION ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    #
    # By default, MNW solves for the first solver iteration the nodal pumping rate
    #   and subtracts it from the RHS vector (like the WEL package).
    #   Then the next solver iteration applies the well head and conductance to the HCOF vector (like the GHB package).
    #   Then the next solver flips back to using the RHS side, and then HCOF again, and so forth until convergence is met.
    #
    # Option indicates that MNW2 should only solve using the RHS vector only (WEL package like solution)
    RHS_ONLY
    #
    # Option indicates that MNW2 should only solve using the HCOF vector only (GHB package like solution)
    HCOF_ONLY
    #
    # MNW2 flips between RHS and HCOF until MxIter solver iterations, and then only solves using HCOF.
    ONLY_HCOF_AFTER  MxIter
