# Listing of all available Options for the SFR package
#
# Options are grouped based on common usage or when only one should be selected
#
# The Option block is placed at the start of the SFR package input.
#    If there are multiple block style inputs (BEGIN/END), the order of the blocks does not matter.
#
BEGIN OPTIONS
    #
    # Suppress writing SFR stream network to LIST file after reading input.
    NO_PRINT
    #
    # Read network for first stress period, then reuse for rest of simulation.
    #   Use Time Series Input, TABFILEs, or LineFeed to specify segment FLOW
    AUTOMATIC_NEGATIVE_ITMP
    #
    # Adjusts the stream bottom elevation if it is lower than the upper most active cell bottom.  --> Warning, this can cause the gradient of the stream reach to shift.
    FIX_STREAM_BOTTOM
    #
    # By default SFR automatically uses the upper most non-dry model cell for determining the SFR reach stream-aquifer interaction.
    #   The following option disables changing the SFR reach layer and uses the layer number specified in the SFR input.
    NO_REACH_LAYER_CHANGE
    #
    #   The following option only changes the SFR reach if it is deeper than the currently assigned one.
    REACH_LAYER_CHANGE_DEEPER
    #
    # Indicates that IFACE value for modpath is read by reach.
    #   This can also be initiated by the option "AUXILIARY IFACE"
    IFACE
    #
    # NSTRM<0 is the same as including REACHINPUT and TRANSROUTE ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    #
    # Indicates that input reads ISFROPT,
    #   which controls the format for entering reach and segment data and if unsaturated flow beneath streams is simulated.
    REACHINPUT
    #
    # Indicates that input reads IRTFLG, which defines if transient streamflow routing is active.
    #   If IRTFLG > 0 then streamflow will be routed using the kinematic-wave equation.
    TRANSROUTE
    #
    # Output Files ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    #   Generic_Output is a place holder for the output file location.
    #   The file name that is commented to the right is the recommended name.
    #   Example use:
    #               DBFILE   ./output/SFR_Streamflow.txt
    #
    # Print for each SFR reach, for all time steps, in a column based format, reach inflow, seepage, reach outflow, and base properties.
    DBFILE                  Generic_Output                  # SFR_Streamflow.txt Segment/Reach -> inflow/outflow/seepage
    #
    #
    # Print SFR head, flows, and convergence information by iteration for every time step to a file.
    #  Useful for diagnosing SFR network problems for time steps that fail to converge.
    #  NTERM       is the number of worst model cells with a stream reach within to print (for example, NTERM = 2 will print every solver iteration the 2 worst SFR reaches).
    #  OUTER_START is the solver iteration number to start printing the convergence information.
    #                 If set to 0, then output is only for the last solver iteration.
    #                 If set   <0, then output is only for MXITER + OUTER_START solver iterations (that is, the last OUTER_START iterations).
    #
    PRINT_GW_FLOW_RESIDUAL  NTERM  OUTER_START  Generic_Output    # 1 0 ./conv_sfr.txt    -> SFR residual convergence (RCLOSE)
    #
    # Prints all reaches for a segment that contains the reach with the worst residual error.
    #   For example, Segment 3 has 4 reaches;
    #                Segment 3 Reach 2 after a solver iteration has the largest residual error compared to all segment/reaches in the network;
    #                then the head and residual information is printed for that solver iteration for Segment 3 at Reach 1, 2, 3, and 4.
    PRINT_SEGMENT_GW_FLOW_RESIDUAL  OUTER_START  Generic_Output    # 0 ./conv_sfr_seg.txt
    #
    # Advanced Options ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    #
    #  Indicate how the water table elevation is calculated.
    #  The water table elevation determines the amount of evaporation and transpiration from groundwater.
    #
    #  The default is to use the head solution (HNEW) at the end of the time step.
    #  It may be more accurate to use a combination of the head at the start of the time step (HOLD) with HNEW.
    #
    #  HEAD_PREDICTOR_FACTOR specifies a weight for determining the water table (WT) from HNEW and HOLD
    #     WT = FACT*HNEW + (1-FACT)*HOLD
    #
    #  FACT should be set to 0.0 or 0.5 or 1.0 to indicate using only HOLD, the average, or only HNEW
    #
    #  If keyword is not specified, then, by default, FACT = 1 which makes:
    #     WT = HNEW
    HEAD_PREDICTOR_FACTOR FACTOR
    #
    # Special Options - NOT RECOMMENDED - USE WITH CAUTION ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    #
    # By default, after a time step groundwater head solution is complete then
    #   SFR solves the stream network and associated stream-aquifer interaction before caculating the groundwater volumetric budgets.
    #   This makes the SFR solution a half solver iteration ahead of the groundwater solution (that is, streamflow is groundwater head dependent).
    #
    # The following option disables recalculating the SFR stream flows at the end of the time step.
    #   This makes the SFR solution a half solver iteration behind   the groundwater solution (that is, groundwater head is streamflow dependent).
    NO_BUDGET_RECALCULATE_FLOW
    #
    #  This next option is the default when NO_BUDGET_RECALCULATE_FLOW is not specified.
    #    It is provided for the user to explicitly specify the default operation.
       BUDGET_RECALCULATE_FLOW
    #
    # These two options should only be used if you have floating-point overflow issues.
    # They impose flow and depth limits that are defined for each SFR segment, but applied all reaches in the network.
    #
    #   MAX_STAGE defines a maximum stream stage (depth) allowed in a segment 
    #               That is, a limit on the distance above the stream bottom. 
    #    MAX_FLOW defines a maximum stream flow allowed along a segment. 
    #               This limits inflow into each reach, potential flow to/from groundwater, and outflow of the reach.
    #
    # These options are draconian with overriding calculated values, irrelevant of mass errors.
    #    So you should only set them to values that should never occur in the modeled reality.
    #
    # Input uses the Universal Loader (ULOAD) to read with NSEG values with List-Style. 
    #    The INTERNAL directive is not allowed.
    #
    #    For example, assume that NSEG=3, and you want to specify a max flow of 1e10 m^3/d and max depth of 2, 4, and 6 m 
    #                 MAX_FLOW  CONSTANT 1.0e10
    #                 MAX_STAGE OPEN/CLOSE SFR_seg_stage_lim.txt
    #
    #    and SFR_seg_stage_lim.txt has:
    #      _____________________________________
    #     |  # SFR stage depth limit by segment |
    #     |  1   2.0                            |
    #     |  2   4.0                            |
    #     |  3   4.0                            |
    #     |_____________________________________|
    #
    # *Note that, floating-point overflow issues can also occur due to bad parameterization.
    #     A common method for preventing SFR floating-point overflows is to reduce the streambed hydraulic conductivity (HCOND1 and HCOND2)
    #
    MAX_STAGE ULOAD
    MAX_FLOW  ULOAD
    #
    # Global factor that is multiplied the streambed hydraulic conductivity (HCOND1 and HCOND2)
    #   for calculating stream loss for all SFR stream reaches.
    LOSSFACTOR    FACTOR
    #
    # Apply a relaxation factor (RELAX) to aquifer head when making seepage calculation.
    #   This might help for unstable stream networks, but may be better to use HEAD_PREDICTOR_FACTOR instead.
    HEAD_RELAXATION  RELAX
    #
    # MF-NWT style TABFILE. NUMTAB is the number of file unit numbers that are read.
    # MAXROW is the size of the largest tabfile (most rows/lines in the file).
    # Recommended to use either Time Series Input Block (see below)
    #   Or MF-OWHM style TABFILE with keyword specified as TABFILE outside of options block.
    TABFILES  NUMTAB MAXROW
    #

  #             NEXT_VALUE          -> Use FLOW with date closest, that does     exceed, the time step starting date
  #             NEAREST             -> Use FLOW with date closest to the time step starting date
