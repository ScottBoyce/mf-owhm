# Listing of all available Options for the SUB package

# The Option block is placed at the start of the SUB package input.

BEGIN OPTIONS
    #
    #
    # Declares that the SUB package includes parameters and how many parameters are going to be defined.
    #   NSBP is the number subsidence parameters
    #   IPRNTFLG is print flag for UPARARRSUB1 - set to 0 to disable printing
    PARAMETER   NSBP   IPRNTFLG
    #
    # If SEPARATE_FLOWS is present than volumetric budgets will 
    # print elastic and inelastic compaction flow separately.
    # This also affects the Cell-By-Cell binary output (ZoneBudget.exe).
    # If not present, then the two values are combined.
    #      For example, if the BAS package specifies the option BUDGETDB and SEPARATE_FLOWS is not present then budget file has the following headers:
    #         SUB_INST_IN, SUB_INST_OUT, SUB_DELAY_IN, SUB_DELAY_OUT
    # 
    #      If present, then the following headers are present
    #         SUB_INST_EL_IN, SUB_INST_EL_OUT, SUB_INST_IE_IN, SUB_INST_IE_OUT, SUB_DELAY_EL_IN, SUB_DELAY_EL_OUT, SUB_DELAY_IE_IN, SUB_DELAY_IE_OUT
    # 
    #      where INST  is for instantaneous compaction
    #            DELAY is for delayed compaction
    #            EL    is for elastic 
    #            IE    is for inelastic
    #
    #      Similarly the LIST volumetric budget has the following headers when SEPARATE_FLOWS is not present:
    #         "INST. IB STORAGE"    "DELAY IB STORAGE"
    # 
    #      If present, then the following headers are present
    #         "SUB INST    ELAS"    "SUB INST  INELAS"    "SUB DELAY   ELAS"    "SUB DELAY INELAS"
    #
    SEPARATE_FLOWS
    #
    # Advanced Options ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    #
    # If present than the subsidence link to the DIS and LPF/UPW packages is enabled. 
    #   This allow the SUB package to change the model grid's vertical elevation in response to aquifer compaction.
