# Listing of all available Options for the BAS package
#
# Options are grouped based on common usage or when only one should be selected
#
# The Option block is placed at the start of the BAS package input.
#    If there are multiple block style inputs (BEGIN/END), the order of the blocks does not matter.

BEGIN OPTIONS
    #
    # Specify the starting calendar date for the simulation.
    #          DATE must be in one of the accepted formats: mm/dd/yyyy or yyyy-mm-dd or mm/dd/yyyyThh:MM:ss or yyyy-mm-ddThh:MM:ss or DecimalYear
    START_DATE  DATE
    #
    # If a time step fails to meet the solver's convergence criteria, do not stop the simulation.
    NO_FAILED_CONVERGENCE_STOP
    #
    # Prints to terminal window, LIST, and WARN files the volumetric budget
    #   If the percent mass error exceeds MinP. That is, "Print Budget" is invoked when %Error > MinP.
    #   If not specified then MinP = 5%
    PERCENTERROR  MinP
    #
    # Simulation continues unless %Error > StpP. --Note "NO_FAILED_CONVERGENCE_STOP" is equivalent to "STOP_ERROR  1E30"
    STOP_ERROR    StpP
    #
    # Define the maximum allowed relative volume error (MxRE), where the Relative volume error is: Cell_Volume_Error / Cell_Volume
    #          This is applied in addition to the standard solver criteria (HCLOSE and RCLOSE)
    #          MxRE = 0.025 is the default. Specify MxRE = 2.0 to disable (or any large number)
    MAX_RELATIVE_VOLUME_ERROR  MxRE
    #
    # Require the user to press Enter after the simulation completes.
    #   Useful to hold terminal window open after simulation is complete, BUT bad for automatic calibration.

    #
    # Run model but don't solve gw equation to cycle through all input filesÂ 
    INPUT_CHECK
    #
    #  Run model from Stress Period (or Date) STR to STP.
    #          STP is optional (otherwise its set to NPER)
    #          Note that the initial head (STRT) defined in the BAS
    #          is carried forward and used as the starting head for STR.         --Note that INPUT_CHECK is the same as  FASTFORWARD NPER+1

    # Has the same effect as including the "COMPACT BUDGET" in the Output Control (OC) package

    # Indicates that the output written to the cell-by-cell (CBC) binary file should be double precision instead of single for all floating point numbers. This doubles its size and is not recommended.

    # Default is to print every the iteration count every 10 solver iterations to command prompt
    #
    NO_SHOWPROGRESS # Disables "Solver Iter" printing; useful if redirecting cmd output to a file.
    #
    SHOWPROGRESS [NPRT] # Prints every 10 or NPRT iterations HCLOSE and RCLOSE; NPRT < 0 only prints the solver iter # every |NPRT| iterations; OneWater default is "SHOWPROGRESS -10"
                        # Note that "SHOWPROGRESS 0" is identical to "NO_SHOWPROGRESS"

    #
    # Set the size of the maximum number of parameters, clusters, and instances, which is MaxPar, MaxCluster, MaxInstance, respectively.
    #   Default when not specified is:       MAXPARAM  2000  2000000  50000
    #   If not using parameters you can set: MAXPARAM  63    64       1

    # Set the size the number of volumetric budgets (MxBud) that are kept track of.

    #  NTERM       is the number of worst model cells to print (for example, NTERM = 2 will print every solver iteration the 2 worst model cells).
    #  OUTER_START is the solver iteration number to start printing the convergence information.
