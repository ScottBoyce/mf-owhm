PRINT SFR_DELIVERY Output file from FMP SURFACE_WATER Block

Writes for each time step the semi-routed delivery (SRD) flow 
(water diverted) to meet the the a WBS water demand.

SRD is defined by the SEMI_ROUTED_DELIVERY keyword
and have identification numbers (ISRD) from 1 to NSFR_DELIV.

If the ISRR is set to 0, then the WBS did not have
a SRD location defined (no possible SFR diversion).

The output may be text or binary format.

If the output file is text format, then it will contain a single header line
followed by the output written for each time step. If the output file is binary format,
then each times step writes a binary record containing only the output data.

                                 INFLOW   -> Delivery limited by SFR_INFLOW                 (Demand > SFR_INFLOW)
                                 LIMIT    -> Delivery limited by LOWER_LIMIT or UPPER_LIMIT (Demand > UPPER_LIMIT - LOWER_LIMIT)
                                 UNKNOWN  -> Failed to identify why delivery was less than demand

Date output is formatted using ISO 8601-1:2019 standard without a time zone designation:
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601#Combined_date_and_time_representations

The general format is:
yyyy-mm-ddThh:mm:ss
                   where:
                         yyyy is the four digit Gregorian year
                         mm   before the T is the two digit month number       (01 to 12)
                         dd   is the two digit day of the month                (01 to {28, 29, 30, 31}, depending on the month)
                         T    calendar date and 24-hour clock time separator
                         hh   is the hour within the day                       (00 to 23 hour)
                         mm   after the T is the two digit minutes in the hour (00 to 59 minute)
                         ss   is the two digit seconds of the minute           (00 to 59 second)

Output is in model units that uses an
   L as a place holder for Length, L2 is for area, L3 is for volume and
   T as a place holder for Time

which are defined in the DIS package as being:
   L: Feet, Meters, Centimeters, and Undefined
   T: Seconds, Minutes, Hours, Days, Years, and Undefined

WBS_SFR_DMD With Multiple Delivery Points for a WBS

FMP surface water demand (WBS_SFR_DMD) is requested first to the SRD with the lowest ISRD number. 
The water delivered is removed from the WBS_SFR_DMD and then requested from the next SRD location.
This continues until either WBS_SFR_DMD reaches zero or there are no more delivery locations.

Example 1

WBS 7 has 3 ISRD locations (for simplicity, lets call it ISRD= [1, 2, 3])
The SRD locations have the following deliveries:
ISRD  DELIVERY  
1     10
2     20
3     30

If WBS 7 has a total surface water demand of 100, then the following would be reported.

ISRD  DELIVERY  WBS_SFR_DMD
1     10        100
2     20        90         -> Demand is now 90 because 10 was delivered by ISRD 1
3     30        70         -> Demand is now 70 because 10 was delivered by ISRD 1 and 20 from ISRD 2

Example 2


ISRD  DELIVERY  
1     70
2     30
3     0

ISRD  DELIVERY  WBS_SFR_DMD
1     10        100
2     30        30         -> Demand is now 30 because 70 was delivered by ISRD 1
3      0         0         -> Demand is now 70 because 70 was delivered by ISRD 1 and 30 from ISRD 2 to fully meet the demand

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

By default the SEMI_ROUTED_DELIVERY removes all the water available from the specified SFR Segment/Reach.
Both a Lower and Upper limit can be imposed for each delivery location.

The lower limit, SEMI_ROUTED_DELIVERY_LOWER_LIMIT, is similar to a flood-control type of diversion in SFR (IPRIOR = -3).
 Only flow that is greater then the lower limit is available to the WBS.
 
The upper limit, SEMI_ROUTED_DELIVERY_UPPER_LIMIT, is the maximum flow that a WBS can remove.
 Only flow that is beneath this limit is available to the WBS.

If both the lower and upper limits are applied then the available water is their difference.

For Example, note all numbers have units L^3/T,

 A Lower Limit of 10 and upper limit of 50 would allow not allow a WBS more then 40 because 50 - 10 = 40

     If the flow in SFR is <10, then no water is available to the WBS

     If the flow in SFR is between 10 and 50, then the water is available to the WBS is the FLOW - 10
               --For example the flow is 30, then the available flow is 20 because 30 - 10 = 20

     If the flow in SFR is >50, then the water is available to the WBS is 40 because 50 - 10 = 40

   *** Note that the ALLOTMENT block imposes an additional limit on the total surface water supply to each WBS.

  Both the Lower and Upper Limits use List-Style that read NSFR_DELIV records.

   *** If SEMI_ROUTED_DELIVERY_LOWER_LIMIT is NOT specified, it is set to 0.0    --No lower limit
   *** If SEMI_ROUTED_DELIVERY_UPPER_LIMIT is NOT specified, it is set to 1E100  --No upper limit
