PRINT ByWELL Output file from FMP SUPPLY_WELL Block

Writes for each time step the FMP Supply Wells location, capacity, desired pumping rate, 
and actual pumping rate. Only wells that are in use during the time step are printed. 
Note, that output will include wells that are available for time step, 
but have zero pumping capacity.

The output may be text or binary format.

If the output file is text format, then it will contain a single header line
followed by the output written for each time step. If the output file is binary format,
then each times step writes a binary record containing only the output data.

PER                        is the stress period number
STP                        is the time step number
WBS                        is the Water Balance Subregion (Farm) ID number that the FMP supply well provides water to (pumps to meet the WBS demand)
WELLID                     is the name of the FMP supply well
Q-CAP-INI         [L3/T]   is the initial FMP supply well’s pumping capacity as specified by the input
Q-CAP-FIN         [L3/T]   is the finial  FMP supply well’s pumping capacity. This is reduced by the SMOOTH option or the ALLOTMENTS block, but typically equal to Q-CAP-INI.
Q-ACT             [L3/T]   is the actual  FMP supply well’s pumping rate. This will either be equal to Q-CAP-FIN or the necessary pumpage to meet demand.
Q-DES-DMD         [L3/T]   is the desired FMP supply well’s pumping rate to meet the WBS demand. This will equal either Q-ACT or the total pumpage needed to meet demand.
LAY                        is the well's model layer number; it is set to zero if well is linked to MNW2
ROW                        is the well's model row number
COL                        is the well's model column number
DELT              [T]      is the time step length
DYEAR                      is the date at the end of the time step as a decimal year
DATE_START                 is the starting calendar date of the time step in the form: yyyy-mm-ddThh:mm:ss

Date output is formatted using ISO 8601-1:2019 standard without a time zone designation:
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601#Combined_date_and_time_representations

The general format is:
yyyy-mm-ddThh:mm:ss
                   where:
                         yyyy is the four digit Gregorian year
                         mm   before the T is the two digit month number       (01 to 12)
                         dd   is the two digit day of the month                (01 to {28, 29, 30, 31}, depending on the month)
                         T    calendar date and 24-hour clock time separator
                         hh   is the hour within the day                       (00 to 23 hour)
                         mm   after the T is the two digit minutes in the hour (00 to 59 minute)
                         ss   is the two digit seconds of the minute           (00 to 59 second)

Output is in model units that uses an
   L as a place holder for Length, L2 is for area, L3 is for volume and
   T as a place holder for Time

which are defined in the DIS package as being:
   L: Feet, Meters, Centimeters, and Undefined
   T: Seconds, Minutes, Hours, Days, Years, and Undefined

The MODFLOW-OWHM standard binary formatting is set to
Fortran Unformatted Stream (C style binary).

The description of each header indicates the Fortran variable
that is used to write the binary recorded.

The following explain their storage use:

DOUBLE        8 bytes      Double Precision      numpy.dtype('float64')  REAL(kind=real64)
INTEGER       4 bytes      Integer               numpy.dtype('int32')    INTEGER(kind=int32)
CHARACTER(X)  X × 1 bytes  Character(X)          numpy.dtype('SX')       CHARACTER(len=X)

FMP Supply wells are defined with a start and end date for providing supply to a Water Balance Subregion (WBS).
The Supply well is considered not available for time steps that occur before the start date and after the end date.

An FMP Supply well can be linked to MNW2. This is done by specifying LAY equal to 0 or MNW2 and the WELLID matches
to a MNW2 well with the same WELLID. MNW2-linked wells have FMP specify the desired pumping rate (Qdes) based 
on the WBS demand, then MNW2 determines the actual pumping rate (Qact) based on the aquifer conditions. 

The SUPPY_WELL SMOOTH keyword allows reduction of non-MWN2 linked wells when the water table approaches 
the bottom of the model cell. This simulates a loss of production capacity due to insufficient water.
The change in capacity is reflected in the difference between Q-CAP-INI and Q-CAP-FIN.

The ALLOTMENTS block GROUNDWATER allotment keyword specifies a total groundwater pumpage limit. If the
total pumpage for the WBS reaches the groundwater allotment, then the curtailment that is applied to
the supply well is reflected in the difference between Q-CAP-INI and Q-CAP-FIN.
