PRINT ByWBS_ByLAYER Output file from FMP SUPPLY_WELL Block

Writes for each time step the FMP supply well’s pumping rate,
from FMP Supply Wells (Regular and MNW2 linked) and non-FMP MNW2 and WEL package,
summarized by Water Balance Subregion (WBS) and by model Layer.

The output may be text or binary format.

If the output file is text format, then it will contain a single header line
followed by the output written for each time step. If the output file is binary format,
then each times step writes a binary record containing only the output data.

WEL_RATE_IN       [L3/T]   is the inflow  to   groundwater from WEL package wells that are located with in the WBS area.
WEL_RATE_OUT      [L3/T]   is the outflow from groundwater from WEL package wells that are located with in the WBS area.
DELT              [T]      is the time step length
DYEAR                      is the date at the end of the time step as a decimal year
DATE_START                 is the starting calendar date of the time step in the form: yyyy-mm-ddThh:mm:ss

Date output is formatted using ISO 8601-1:2019 standard without a time zone designation:
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601#Combined_date_and_time_representations

The general format is:
yyyy-mm-ddThh:mm:ss
                   where:
                         yyyy is the four digit Gregorian year
                         mm   before the T is the two digit month number       (01 to 12)
                         dd   is the two digit day of the month                (01 to {28, 29, 30, 31}, depending on the month)
                         T    calendar date and 24-hour clock time separator
                         hh   is the hour within the day                       (00 to 23 hour)
                         mm   after the T is the two digit minutes in the hour (00 to 59 minute)
                         ss   is the two digit seconds of the minute           (00 to 59 second)

Output is in model units that uses an
   L as a place holder for Length, L2 is for area, L3 is for volume and
   T as a place holder for Time

which are defined in the DIS package as being:
   L: Feet, Meters, Centimeters, and Undefined
   T: Seconds, Minutes, Hours, Days, Years, and Undefined

The MODFLOW-OWHM standard binary formatting is set to
Fortran Unformatted Stream (C style binary).

The description of each header indicates the Fortran variable
that is used to write the binary recorded.

The following explain their storage use:

Keyword       Storage      Default Fortran Type  Python Numpy Type       Fortran 2003 Standard
DOUBLE        8 bytes      Double Precision      numpy.dtype('float64')  REAL(kind=real64)
INTEGER       4 bytes      Integer               numpy.dtype('int32')    INTEGER(kind=int32)
CHARACTER(X)  X × 1 bytes  Character(X)          numpy.dtype('SX')       CHARACTER(len=X)
SNGL          4 bytes      Real                  numpy.dtype('float32')  REAL(kind=real32)

Note that FMP supply wells are not required to be located within the WBS area.
Due to this, the FMP supply well sum may not reflect the total in and out for the WBS area,
rather it represents the total of all wells associated with the WBS.

Non-FMP wells are not associated with a WBS, so the inflow and outflow
are determined by what MNW2 and WEL package wells are located within
the WBS area.
