PRINT ByMNW Output file from FMP SUPPLY_WELL Block

Writes for each time step the supply information for the 
FMP Supply Wells that are linked to MNW2. This output file
is similar to the ByWELL option, but only includes wells
that are linked to MNW2. The output includes location, capacity, 
desired pumping rate, and actual pumping rate. 
Only wells that are in use during the time step are printed. 
Note, that output will include wells that are available for time step, 
but have zero pumping capacity.

The output file will contain a single header line
followed by the output written for each time step.

PER                        is the stress period number
STP                        is the time step number
WBS                        is the Water Balance Subregion (Farm) ID number that the FMP supply well provides water to (pumps to meet the WBS demand)
WELLID                     is the name of the FMP supply well that is linked to MNW2. Note that this is also the name of the WELLID used in MNW2 as well.
Q-CAP-INI         [L3/T]   is the initial FMP-MNW2 linked supply well’s pumping capacity as specified by the input
Q-ACT             [L3/T]   is the actual  FMP-MNW2 linked supply well’s pumping rate. This will either be equal to Q-CAP-FIN or the necessary pumpage to meet demand.
Q-DES-DMD         [L3/T]   is the desired FMP-MNW2 linked supply well’s pumping rate to meet the WBS demand. This will equal either Q-ACT or the total pumpage needed to meet demand. In MNW2, this is set to Qdes.
H-WEL             [L]      is the MNW2 calculated well head (elevation of water within the wellbore).
H-CEL-AVE         [L]      is the MNW2 well's aquifer head. If the well is screened over multiple layers/cells, then the head is a conductance weighted average.
DELT              [T]      is the time step length
DYEAR                      is the date at the end of the time step as a decimal year
DATE_START                 is the starting calendar date of the time step in the form: yyyy-mm-ddThh:mm:ss

Date output is formatted using ISO 8601-1:2019 standard without a time zone designation:
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601#Combined_date_and_time_representations

The general format is:
yyyy-mm-ddThh:mm:ss
                   where:
                         yyyy is the four digit Gregorian year
                         mm   before the T is the two digit month number       (01 to 12)
                         dd   is the two digit day of the month                (01 to {28, 29, 30, 31}, depending on the month)
                         T    calendar date and 24-hour clock time separator
                         hh   is the hour within the day                       (00 to 23 hour)
                         mm   after the T is the two digit minutes in the hour (00 to 59 minute)
                         ss   is the two digit seconds of the minute           (00 to 59 second)

Output is in model units that uses an
   L as a place holder for Length, L2 is for area, L3 is for volume and
   T as a place holder for Time

which are defined in the DIS package as being:
   L: Feet, Meters, Centimeters, and Undefined
   T: Seconds, Minutes, Hours, Days, Years, and Undefined

FMP Supply wells are defined with a start and end date for providing supply to a Water Balance Subregion (WBS).
The Supply well is considered not available for time steps that occur before the start date and after the end date.

An FMP Supply well can be linked to MNW2. This is done by specifying LAY equal to 0 or MNW2 and the WELLID matches
to a MNW2 well with the same WELLID. MNW2-linked wells have FMP specify the desired pumping rate (Qdes) based 
on the WBS demand, then MNW2 determines the actual pumping rate (Qact) based on the aquifer conditions. 

The SUPPY_WELL SMOOTH keyword allows reduction of non-MWN2 linked wells when the water table approaches 
the bottom of the model cell. This simulates a loss of production capacity due to insufficient water.
The change in capacity is reflected in the difference between Q-CAP-INI and Q-CAP-FIN.

The ALLOTMENTS block GROUNDWATER allotment keyword specifies a total groundwater pumpage limit. If the
total pumpage for the WBS reaches the groundwater allotment, then the curtailment that is applied to
the supply well is reflected in the difference between Q-CAP-INI and Q-CAP-FIN.
