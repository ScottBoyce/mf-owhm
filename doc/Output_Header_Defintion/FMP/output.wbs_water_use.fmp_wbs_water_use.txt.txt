WBS_WATER_USE (FMP_WBS_WATER_USE.txt) Output file from FMP OUTPUT Block

Writes every time step, for each Water Balance Subregions's (WBS) 
that is in use for the time step, the major water use components
in the landscape: evapotranspiration, precipitation, and irrigation type applied.

The area of the WBS is divided into an non-irrigated (natural) area
and irrigated area. 

The non-irrigated area can only consume water
from groundwater via the crop roots or precipitation. 

The irrigated area consumes water from groundwater via the crop roots,
precipitation, and applied irrigation.

The output may only be in text format.

P_NAT           [L3/T]        is the precipitation rate that is applied to      non-irrigated crops (natural sources)

PET_IRR         [L3/T]        is the potential evapotranspiration          from irrigated crops
ETgw_IRR        [L3/T]        is the evapotranspiration from groundwater   from irrigated crops
ETp_IRR         [L3/T]        is the evapotranspiration from precipitation from irrigated crops
ETi_IRR         [L3/T]        is the evapotranspiration from irrigation    from irrigated crops
P_IRR           [L3/T]        is the precipitation rate that is applied to      irrigated crops

DEMAND_POT      [L3/T]        is the WBS potential demand for irrigation water (irrigation water needed to fully meet the WBS's irrigated crop's potential evapotranspiration)
EFFICIENCY                    is total irrigation efficiency (OFE) of the WBS

NRD_USE         [L3/T]        is the portion of irrigation demand satisfied with  non-routed deliveries (NRD)
SRD_USE         [L3/T]        is the portion of irrigation demand satisfied with semi-routed deliveries (SFR Delivery).
Q_USE           [L3/T]        is the portion of irrigation demand satisfied with groundwater pumping    (Supply Well)

DELT            [L3/T]        is the time step length
DYEAR           [L3/T]        is the decimal year at the end of the time step
DATE_START      [L3/T]        is the starting calendar date of the time step in the form: yyyy-mm-ddThh:mm:ss

Date output is formatted using ISO 8601-1:2019 standard without a time zone designation:
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601#Combined_date_and_time_representations

The general format is:
yyyy-mm-ddThh:mm:ss
                   where:
                         yyyy is the four digit Gregorian year
                         mm   before the T is the two digit month number       (01 to 12)
                         dd   is the two digit day of the month                (01 to {28, 29, 30, 31}, depending on the month)
                         T    calendar date and 24-hour clock time separator
                         hh   is the hour within the day                       (00 to 23 hour)
                         mm   after the T is the two digit minutes in the hour (00 to 59 minute)
                         ss   is the two digit seconds of the minute           (00 to 59 second)

Output is in model units that uses an
   L as a place holder for Length, L2 is for area, L3 is for volume and
   T as a place holder for Time

which are defined in the DIS package as being:
   L: Feet, Meters, Centimeters, and Undefined
   T: Seconds, Minutes, Hours, Days, Years, and Undefined
