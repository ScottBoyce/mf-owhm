PRINT SFR_SRR_ONLY Output file from FMP SURFACE_WATER Block

Writes for each time step runoff to SFR output information 
for semi-routed return reaches (SRR)
summarized by WBS. 

SRR is defined by the SEMI_ROUTED_RETURN keyword
and have identification numbers (ISRR) from 1 to NSFR_RETURN.

If the ISRR is set to -1, then the runoff did not 
have a SFR location and was removed from the model.
Specifically, the runoff is not applied and assumed 
to flow outside the modeled domain.

The output may be text or binary format.

If the output file is text format, then it will contain a single header line
followed by the output written for each time step. If the output file is binary format,
then each times step writes a binary record containing only the output data.

PER                        is the stress period number
STP                        is the time step number
WBS                        is the Water Balance Subregion (Farm) ID number
SEG                        is the SFR Segment number that received the runoff, if set to zero then runoff was removed from the model and not applied to SFR
RCH                        is the SFR Reach   number that received the runoff, if set to zero then runoff was removed from the model and not applied to SFR
RUNOFF            [L3/T]   is the runoff from the WBS that applied to the SFR SEG and RCH.
SFR_INFLOW        [L3/T]   is the upstream flow into the SEG, RCH
SFR_OUTFLOW       [L3/T]   is the outflow from the SEG, RCH, including the runoff (Note that SFR_OUTFLOW = SFR_INFLOW + RUNOFF + other gains and losses to the reach)
DELT              [T]      is the time step length
DYEAR                      is the date at the end of the time step as a decimal year
DATE_START                 is the starting calendar date of the time step in the form: yyyy-mm-ddThh:mm:ss
ISRR                       is the semi-routed return identification number from 1 to NSFR_RETURN (the SRR position in the input)
                              is set to -1 if the runoff was not applied to SFR and was removed from the model

Date output is formatted using ISO 8601-1:2019 standard without a time zone designation:
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601#Combined_date_and_time_representations

The general format is:
yyyy-mm-ddThh:mm:ss
                   where:
                         yyyy is the four digit Gregorian year
                         mm   before the T is the two digit month number       (01 to 12)
                         dd   is the two digit day of the month                (01 to {28, 29, 30, 31}, depending on the month)
                         T    calendar date and 24-hour clock time separator
                         hh   is the hour within the day                       (00 to 23 hour)
                         mm   after the T is the two digit minutes in the hour (00 to 59 minute)
                         ss   is the two digit seconds of the minute           (00 to 59 second)

Output is in model units that uses an
   L as a place holder for Length, L2 is for area, L3 is for volume and
   T as a place holder for Time

which are defined in the DIS package as being:
   L: Feet, Meters, Centimeters, and Undefined
   T: Seconds, Minutes, Hours, Days, Years, and Undefined

The MODFLOW-OWHM standard binary formatting is set to
Fortran Unformatted Stream (C style binary).

The description of each header indicates the Fortran variable
that is used to write the binary recorded.

The following explain their storage use:
