FARM_BUDGET (FB_DETAILS.out) Output file from FMP OUTPUT Block

Writes every time step each Water Balance Subregions's (WBS) landscape flow budget,
where the flow directions are relative to the landscape.
That is, an “-in” flow is a flow that enters the landscape and an “-out”
is a flow that leaves the landscape. Values are always positive.

For example, the precipitation enters the landscape (-in) may leave (-out)
as evaporation, transpiration, runoff, or deep percolation.

Some headers have the same -in and -out values because it is a rate that
passes through the landscape. For example, Q-egw-in and Q-egw-out are always
the same because the evaporation of groundwater originates at the water table
and passes through the landscape through the atmosphere.

The output may be text or binary format.

If the output file is text format, then it will contain a single header line
followed by the output written for each time step. If the output file is binary format,
then each times step writes a binary record containing only the output data.

Date output is formatted using ISO 8601-1:2019 standard without a time zone designation:
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601#Combined_date_and_time_representations

The general format is:
yyyy-mm-ddThh:mm:ss
                   where:
                         yyyy is the four digit Gregorian year
                         mm   before the T is the two digit month number       (01 to 12)
                         dd   is the two digit day of the month                (01 to {28, 29, 30, 31}, depending on the month)
                         T    calendar date and 24-hour clock time separator
                         hh   is the hour within the day                       (00 to 23 hour)
                         mm   after the T is the two digit minutes in the hour (00 to 59 minute)
                         ss   is the two digit seconds of the minute           (00 to 59 second)

Output is in model units that uses an
   L as a place holder for Length, L2 is for area, L3 is for volume and
   T as a place holder for Time

which are defined in the DIS package as being:
   L: Feet, Meters, Centimeters, and Undefined
   T: Seconds, Minutes, Hours, Days, Years, and Undefined
