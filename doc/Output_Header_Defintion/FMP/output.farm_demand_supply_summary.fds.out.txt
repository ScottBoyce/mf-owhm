FARM_DEMAND_SUPPLY_SUMMARY (FDS.out) Output file from FMP OUTPUT Block

Writes every time step each Water Balance Subregions's (WBS) demand for
water and corresponding supplies that were used to meet those demands.
The output may be text or binary format.

If the output file is text format, then it will contain a single header line
followed by the output written for each time step. If the output file is binary format,
then each times step writes a binary record containing only the output data.

PER                     is the stress period
STP                     is the time step
TIMEUNIT                is elapsed simulation time. Note that the word TIMEUNIT is set to the model time unit T: “SECONDS”, “MINUTES”, “HOURS”, “DAYS”, or “YEARS”
FID                     is the WBS (Farm) ID number
OFE                     is total irrigation efficiency of the WBS
TFDR-INI    [L3/T]      is the WBS initial demand for water
NR-SWD-INI  [L3/T]      is the WBS initial demand for non-routed deliveries
R-SWD-INI   [L3/T]      is the WBS initial demand for semi- and fully-routed deliveries. Removed feature, so it will always have a zero value.
QREQ-INI    [L3/T]      is the WBS initial demand for groundwater pumping
TFDR-FIN    [L3/T]      is the WBS amount of demand satisfied with supply
NR-SWD-FIN  [L3/T]      is the portion of demand satisfied with non-routed deliveries
R-SWD-FIN   [L3/T]      is the portion of demand satisfied with semi- and fully-routed deliveries. This is a removed feature in FMP, so it will always have a zero value
QREQ-FIN    [L3/T]      is the demanded groundwater pumping
Q-FIN       [L3/T]      is the portion of demand satisfied with groundwater pumping
DEF-FLAG                is the WBS DEFICIENCY_SCENARIO, 1 indicates Irrigated Crop CU reduced to water supply, 0 indicates Irrigated Crop CU always satisfied by adding external water to meet any supply shortfall
DATE_START              is the starting calendar date of the time step in the form: yyyy-mm-ddThh:mm:ss
ACTIVE                  is set to 1 if the WBS is in use for the stress period and 0 if it is not

Date output is formatted using ISO 8601-1:2019 standard without a time zone designation:
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601#Combined_date_and_time_representations

The general format is:
yyyy-mm-ddThh:mm:ss
                   where:
                         yyyy is the four digit Gregorian year
                         mm   before the T is the two digit month number       (01 to 12)
                         dd   is the two digit day of the month                (01 to {28, 29, 30, 31}, depending on the month)
                         T    calendar date and 24-hour clock time separator
                         hh   is the hour within the day                       (00 to 23 hour)
                         mm   after the T is the two digit minutes in the hour (00 to 59 minute)
                         ss   is the two digit seconds of the minute           (00 to 59 second)

Output is in model units that uses an
   L as a place holder for Length, L2 is for area, L3 is for volume and
   T as a place holder for Time

which are defined in the DIS package as being:
   L: Feet, Meters, Centimeters, and Undefined
   T: Seconds, Minutes, Hours, Days, Years, and Undefined

The MODFLOW-OWHM standard binary formatting is set to
Fortran Unformatted Stream (C style binary).

The description of each header indicates the Fortran variable
that is used to write the binary recorded.

The following explain their storage use:

Keyword       Storage      Default Fortran Type  Python Numpy Type       Fortran 2003 Standard
DOUBLE        8 bytes      Double Precision      numpy.dtype('float64')  REAL(kind=real64)
INTEGER       4 bytes      Integer               numpy.dtype('int32')    INTEGER(kind=int32)
CHARACTER(X)  X × 1 bytes  Character(X)          numpy.dtype('SX')       CHARACTER(len=X)
SNGL          4 bytes      Real                  numpy.dtype('float32')  REAL(kind=real32)
