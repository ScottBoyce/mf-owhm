SP                         is the stress period number
TS                         is the time step number
ITER                       is the number of outer iterations required to solve the time step.
TS_LENGTH         [T]      is the time step length
VOLUME_ERROR      [L3]     is the total volume error for the model: ABS(Total_IN - Total_Out)*TS_LENGTH
RATE_ERROR        [L3/T]   is the total   rate error for the model: ABS(Total_IN - Total_Out)
RAT_PERROR                 is the percent error defined as:         ABS(Total_IN + Total_Out) / 2*ABS(Total_IN - Total_Out)
MONTH                      is the three letter month (mmm) that the start of the time step
DATE_START                 is the starting calendar date of the time step in the form: yyyy-mm-ddThh:mm:ss

Date output is formatted using ISO 8601-1:2019 standard without a time zone designation:
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601#Combined_date_and_time_representations

The general format is:
yyyy-mm-ddThh:mm:ss
                   where:
                         yyyy is the four digit Gregorian year
                         mm   before the T is the two digit month number       (01 to 12)
                         dd   is the two digit day of the month                (01 to {28, 29, 30, 31}, depending on the month)
                         T    calendar date and 24-hour clock time separator
                         hh   is the hour within the day                       (00 to 23 hour)
                         mm   after the T is the two digit minutes in the hour (00 to 59 minute)
                         ss   is the two digit seconds of the minute           (00 to 59 second)
Note that
                        mmm   is the 3 letter representation of the month (for example, JAN, FEB, MAR, APR, ...)

Output is in model units that uses an
   L as a place holder for Length, L2 is for area, L3 is for volume and
   T as a place holder for Time

which are defined in the DIS package as being:
   L: Feet, Meters, Centimeters, and Undefined
   T: Seconds, Minutes, Hours, Days, Years, and Undefined
