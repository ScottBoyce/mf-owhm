BAS Package Options block keyword TIME_INFO

Writes for each time step's temporal information.
That is, the stress period, time step, time step length,
simulated time, decimal year, and calendar date.

Note that the first record reports the stress period and time step
as zero and gives the simulation starting information.

STEP                       is the total number of time steps
SP                         is the stress period number
TS                         is the time step number
DELT              [T]      is the time step length
SIMTIM            [T]      is the total simulated time at the end of the time step
DYEAR                      is the          date at the end of the time step as a decimal year
DATE                       is the calendar date at the end of the time step as: yyyy-mm-ddThh:mm:ss

Date output is formatted using ISO 8601-1:2019 standard without a time zone designation:
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601#Combined_date_and_time_representations

The general format is:
yyyy-mm-ddThh:mm:ss
                   where:
                         yyyy is the four digit Gregorian year
                         mm   before the T is the two digit month number       (01 to 12)
                         dd   is the two digit day of the month                (01 to {28, 29, 30, 31}, depending on the month)
                         T    calendar date and 24-hour clock time separator
                         hh   is the hour within the day                       (00 to 23 hour)
                         mm   after the T is the two digit minutes in the hour (00 to 59 minute)
                         ss   is the two digit seconds of the minute           (00 to 59 second)

Output is in model units that uses an
   L as a place holder for Length, L2 is for area, L3 is for volume and
   T as a place holder for Time

which are defined in the DIS package as being:
   L: Feet, Meters, Centimeters, and Undefined
   T: Seconds, Minutes, Hours, Days, Years, and Undefined
