MWN2 package OPTIONS block PRINT_NODE_INFO output file

Writes for each time step all the active MNW2 wells'
nodal flow rate and other nodal properties. 

Note this produces the same output, with additional information,
as the PRINT_WELL_NODE_FLOW option, but is in a format that has 
the same number of columns (database friendly format).

The output may be text or binary format.

If the output file is text format, then it will contain a single header line
followed by the output written for each time step. If the output file is binary format,
then each times step writes a binary record containing only the output data.

DATE_START                 is the starting calendar date of the time step in the form: yyyy-mm-ddThh:mm:ss
PER                        is the stress period number
STP                        is the time step number
DELT              [T]      is the time step length
WELLID                     is the name of the MWN2 well
NODE                       is the WELLID node number
RATE              [L3/T]   is the node's flow rate with respect to groundwater; positive is inflow, negative is outflow. The sum of all nodal flow rates is the actual pumping rate.
NODE_HEAD         [L]      is the either the well head (water level within the well itself) or the model cell's bottom elevation, which ever is bigger. That is, if the HEAD_WELL is less than the node's bottom elevation, then it is set to the bottom elevation.
CELL_HEAD         [L]      is the model cell's head elevation that the node is located in.
CELL_BOTM         [L]      is the model cell's bottom elevation that the node is located in.
NODE_COND         [L2/T]   is the cell to well conductance at the node. (Conductance between the well's node and the model cell.)
LAY                        is the node's model layer number
ROW                        is the node's model row number
COL                        is the node's model column number

Date output is formatted using ISO 8601-1:2019 standard without a time zone designation:
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601#Combined_date_and_time_representations

The general format is:
yyyy-mm-ddThh:mm:ss
                   where:
                         yyyy is the four digit Gregorian year
                         mm   before the T is the two digit month number       (01 to 12)
                         dd   is the two digit day of the month                (01 to {28, 29, 30, 31}, depending on the month)
                         T    calendar date and 24-hour clock time separator
                         hh   is the hour within the day                       (00 to 23 hour)
                         mm   after the T is the two digit minutes in the hour (00 to 59 minute)
                         ss   is the two digit seconds of the minute           (00 to 59 second)

Output is in model units that uses an
   L as a place holder for Length, L2 is for area, L3 is for volume and
   T as a place holder for Time

which are defined in the DIS package as being:
   L: Feet, Meters, Centimeters, and Undefined
   T: Seconds, Minutes, Hours, Days, Years, and Undefined

The MODFLOW-OWHM standard binary formatting is set to
Fortran Unformatted Stream (C style binary).

The description of each header indicates the Fortran variable
that is used to write the binary recorded.

The following explain their storage use:

Keyword       Storage      Default Fortran Type  Python Numpy Type       Fortran 2003 Standard
DOUBLE        8 bytes      Double Precision      numpy.dtype('float64')  REAL(kind=real64)
INTEGER       4 bytes      Integer               numpy.dtype('int32')    INTEGER(kind=int32)
CHARACTER(X)  X × 1 bytes  Character(X)          numpy.dtype('SX')       CHARACTER(len=X)
SNGL          4 bytes      Real                  numpy.dtype('float32')  REAL(kind=real32)
