MWN2 package OPTIONS block PRINT_WELL_PUMPING output file

Writes for each time step all the active MNW2 wells'
pumping rate and well head.

The output may be text or binary format.

If the output file is text format, then it will contain a single header line
followed by the output written for each time step. If the output file is binary format,
then each times step writes a binary record containing only the output data.

DATE_START                 is the starting calendar date of the time step in the form: yyyy-mm-ddThh:mm:ss
PER                        is the stress period number
STP                        is the time step number
DELT              [T]      is the time step length
WELLID                     is the name of the MWN2 well
PUMPING_RATE_INI  [L3/T]   is the MNW2 desired pumping rate (Qdes); this is the initial pumping rate assigned to the nodes.
PUMPING_RATE      [L3/T]   is the MNW2 actual  pumping rate (Qact) that is determined based on aquifer conditions and the well head.
HEAD_WELL         [L]      is the MNW2 well head (this is the water level within the well itself)

Date output is formatted using ISO 8601-1:2019 standard without a time zone designation:
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601#Combined_date_and_time_representations

The general format is:
yyyy-mm-ddThh:mm:ss
                   where:
                         yyyy is the four digit Gregorian year
                         mm   before the T is the two digit month number       (01 to 12)
                         dd   is the two digit day of the month                (01 to {28, 29, 30, 31}, depending on the month)
                         T    calendar date and 24-hour clock time separator
                         hh   is the hour within the day                       (00 to 23 hour)
                         mm   after the T is the two digit minutes in the hour (00 to 59 minute)
                         ss   is the two digit seconds of the minute           (00 to 59 second)

Output is in model units that uses an
   L as a place holder for Length, L2 is for area, L3 is for volume and
   T as a place holder for Time

which are defined in the DIS package as being:
   L: Feet, Meters, Centimeters, and Undefined
   T: Seconds, Minutes, Hours, Days, Years, and Undefined

The MODFLOW-OWHM standard binary formatting is set to
Fortran Unformatted Stream (C style binary).

The description of each header indicates the Fortran variable
that is used to write the binary recorded.

The following explain their storage use:

Keyword       Storage      Default Fortran Type  Python Numpy Type       Fortran 2003 Standard
DOUBLE        8 bytes      Double Precision      numpy.dtype('float64')  REAL(kind=real64)
INTEGER       4 bytes      Integer               numpy.dtype('int32')    INTEGER(kind=int32)
CHARACTER(X)  X × 1 bytes  Character(X)          numpy.dtype('SX')       CHARACTER(len=X)
SNGL          4 bytes      Real                  numpy.dtype('float32')  REAL(kind=real32)
